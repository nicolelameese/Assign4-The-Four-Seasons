                <br>My goal around this page was to create the feelings of the seasons through 
                visual animations with type and colour animations. Each one of the words 
                for each season has a specific animation choice made for them so they would
                most accuratly represent their word's meaning, such as summer I used the colours 
                of the rainbow as summer makes me think of rainbows and then there is a big glare 
                of yellow almost making it hard to read the word 'Summer', this was a mindful choice 
                as I felt it represented the glare of the summer sun on your eyes. And more obviously 
                the word 'Fall' is being animated to fall downwards, this was so it would look like it 
                is falling like a leaf would in the fall season. With the word 'Spring' I chose to minipulate
                a variable font to seem as if it is growing under the spring flowers, or even springing under
                the flowers. Finally, for the word 'Winter' I went with a subtly change of colour in the word
                of various blues to make it feel like your freezing and thawing as snow and ice do in the winter. <br>
